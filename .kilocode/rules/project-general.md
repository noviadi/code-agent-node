## Brief overview
This document outlines the development workflow for this project, based on our initial collaboration.

## Coding best practices
- For this project, we are using TypeScript.
- Structure the code for clarity. For example, API calls should be in separate functions (e.g., `runInference`).
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like API keys.

## Tool Usage
- Use `context7` to get up-to-date documentation and examples for libraries.
